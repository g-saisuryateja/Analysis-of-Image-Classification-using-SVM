# Analysis-of-Image-Classification-using-SVM

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to classify Images and we are
trying to understand SVM performs for Large Dataset vs Small Dataset and Binary vs Multi Classification.
Two Datasets “Dogs Vs Cats”(Large, binary classification) and “Color
Classification” (Small, multi classification)  are used.
